        "bio": "Pixelord delivers a refined, emotive melting pot of sounds that stands alone in the ever evolving world of electronic music. Tough and touching in the same breath, Alexey Devayin is at the forefront of an ever-evolving Russian scene that many consider one of most exciting musical developments in recent years. \n \nPixelord sits among a current wealth of producers where sound dominates over genre, mashing elements of Futuristic Bass, Footwork, Garage and Grime together into a unique take on bass music. Over the past year Pixelord has released music for tastemaker labels such as Error Broadcast, Leisure System, Infinite Machine and Hit & Hope to critical acclaim. In 2014 Pixelord performed at the first ever Boiler Room in Russia, toured USA and China. In 2015 collaborated with Marcos Zotes to make soundtrack for videomapping installation in Moscow.",

        "name":"Second Sun",
        "bio": "Second Sun is an original acoustic rock project emanating out of Canberra, Australia. Ethereal lyrics are set in motion over dark, melodic riffs on big open tuned guitars, grounded by solid rock drum beats. The illegitimate love child of Canberra songwriter and musician, Aleshia Flanagan, Second Sun has been gradually expanding into existence since 2009. The project finally materialised in March 2012 with the release of a self-titled debut album. With the addition of Toby King on drums in 2011 and Marc David Myles on Keys/vocals in 2012, Second Sun is now complete and on the road in 2012 touring their debut album. The band is also preparing for their next recording - a concept album entitled ‘Balance and Falling’ to be released in 2013.",
