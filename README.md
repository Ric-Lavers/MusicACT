### Website redesign
#### Client: MusicACT
#### address: (www.musicact.com.au)

This Node.JS API and React app is a redesign of the current MusicACT website.

Its intention is to improve the UX of the site providing users a modern experience, and build upon previous features. The previous site was built in Drupal around 2012 and has limited updating (save for blog posts around 3 times a year), in addition to the blog the other main feature is a directory that allows musicians, venues and businesses create a profile that listed on the site. Minor features include a members sign up, email confirmation, admin rights (including editing, deleting profiles, banning users), password recovery, JWT tokens, document downloads.
